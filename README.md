## üîß How It Works

### **Authentication Process**
1. **YouTube Authentication**: Opens a browser window for Google OAuth 2.0 login
2. **Spotify Authentication**: Opens a browser window for Spotify OAuth 2.0 login
3. **Token Management**: Automatically handles access tokens and refresh tokens

### **Data Processing Pipeline**
1. **Fetch Liked Videos**: Retrieves all videos from your YouTube "Liked Videos" playlist
2. **Song Extraction**: Analyzes video titles using multiple regex patterns:
- `Artist - Song`
- `Artist: Song`
- `Artist "Song"`
- `Song by Artist`
3. **Spotify Search**: Uses multiple search strategies for better matching:
- Exact track and artist search
- Quoted search terms
- General keyword search
- Track-specific and artist-specific searches

### **User Interaction**
1. **Choice Prompt**: After processing, you choose between:
- Adding songs to your Spotify liked songs
- Creating a new playlist with a custom name
2. **Batch Processing**: Songs are added in optimal batch sizes (50 for liked songs, 100 for playlists)

### **Results Summary**
- Total videos processed
- Successfully matched songs
- Failed matches with reasons
- Overall success rate percentage

## üìä Usage

1. **Run the script**:
```
python youtube_to_spotify.py
```


3. **Follow the authentication prompts**:
- Browser windows will open for YouTube and Spotify login
- Grant the requested permissions

3. **Wait for processing**:
- The script will fetch and analyze your liked videos
- Progress updates will be displayed in real-time

4. **Make your choice**:
- Choose option 1 to add songs to your liked songs
- Choose option 2 to create a new playlist and enter a name

5. **Review the summary**:
- Check the final report for successful transfers and any issues

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **API Quotas**: YouTube Data API has daily quotas; the script handles rate limiting automatically
- **Playlist Privacy**: Created playlists are set to private by default
- **Test User Requirement**: You must add your email as a test user in Google Cloud Console if the app is in testing mode
- **Redirect URI**: The redirect URI must exactly match between your script and Spotify app settings
- **Song Matching**: Not all YouTube videos can be matched to Spotify tracks due to:
- Different song titles or artist names
- Songs not available on Spotify
- Videos that aren't actually music

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues and Solutions**

#### **"Access blocked: testinglist has not completed the Google verification process"**
- **Solution**: Add your email address as a test user in Google Cloud Console OAuth consent screen

#### **"INVALID_CLIENT: Insecure redirect URI"**
- **Solution**: Ensure the redirect URI in Spotify Developer Dashboard is exactly `http://127.0.0.1:8080`

#### **"YouTube client secrets file not found"**
- **Solution**: Make sure the `youtube_client_secrets.json` file is in the same directory as your script

#### **"Please update the Spotify credentials in the script"**
- **Solution**: Replace the placeholder values with your actual Spotify Client ID and Client Secret

#### **Low success rate for song matching**
- **Possible causes**: 
- Many non-music videos in your liked videos
- Songs with unusual titles or formatting
- Regional availability differences between YouTube and Spotify

### **Debug Mode**
To see more detailed error messages, you can modify the script to include more verbose logging.
